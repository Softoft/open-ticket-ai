- **On-Premise Deployment**: Runs entirely within your infrastructure using Docker, ensuring no external data sharing and maintaining data privacy.
- **Extensible Pipelines**: Allows for the addition of custom Value Objects (e.g., SLA, tags) to tailor the classification process to your needs.
- **Built-in Hyperparameter Tuner**: Optimizes model performance by automatically finding the best hyperparameters.
- **Optional Chatbot Module**: Includes a chatbot feature to provide automated responses to frequently asked questions.
