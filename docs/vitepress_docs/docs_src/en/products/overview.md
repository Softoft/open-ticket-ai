## Open Ticket AI (On-Prem/Main Product)

- Runs locally; integrates with Znuny/OTRS/OTOBO via adapters.
- Classifies **Queue** & **Priority** on inbound tickets; extensible pipeline architecture.
- Pairs well with our **Synthetic Data Generator** for cold-start or class balancing.

## Hosted Prediction API & Public Base Models (German)

- For teams **without their own data** where the **base queues/priorities** fit reasonably well.
- Use the **German** model via our hosted API (**free for now**).
- Models are **public on Hugging Face**; you can also self-host or fine-tune.

**Start here:** [Prediction API](./prediction-api/overview.md)

---

## Synthetic Data Generator

- Python tool to create realistic, labeled ticket datasets (subject, body, queue, priority, type, tags, language, first
  answer).
- Planned **LGPL** release; email for access or modifications: **sales@softoft.de**.

**Details:** [Synthetic Data Generation](./synthetic-data/synthetic-data-generation.md)

---

## Ticket Datasets

- Multiple versions available:
    - **v5 / v4:** EN & DE, largest and most diverse.
    - **v3:** more languages (e.g., FR/ES/PT), smaller.
- Ideal for bootstrapping, benchmarking, and multilingual experiments.

**Browse:** [Multilingual Customer Support Tickets](./synthetic-data/ticket-dataset.md)

---

## Roadmap

- **English** base model for queue/priority (hosted & downloadable).
- Optional models for **other languages**.
- Additional attributes: **tags**, **assignee**, and **first-answer** generation.
- Early prototype of a **web interface** for the data generator.

## FAQ

**Is the API part of Open Ticket AI?**
No. **Open Ticket AI** runs locally. The **Prediction API** is a separate, hosted service that uses our public models.

**Can I bring my own taxonomy?**
Yes. Train locally with your data, or ask us to generate synthetic data that mirrors your queues/priorities.

**Support & Services?**
We offer support subscriptions and custom integrations. Contact **sales@softoft.de**.
