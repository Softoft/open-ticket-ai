The following sections provide an overview of the core capabilities that help streamline customer service workflows.</p><h2 id="queue-classification" tabindex="-1">Queue Classification <a class="header-anchor" href="#queue-classification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Queue Classification&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Automatically predicts the appropriate queue for each incoming ticket. Departments like IT, Accounting, or Sales receive the requests that are relevant to them without manual triage, speeding up response times.</p><h2 id="priority-prediction" tabindex="-1">Priority Prediction <a class="header-anchor" href="#priority-prediction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Priority Prediction&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Evaluates the urgency of tickets and assigns a priority value. Open Ticket AI can output discrete levels from 1–5 or a continuous score between 0–100, allowing you to adapt the classification to your existing processes.</p><h2 id="low-confidence-handling" tabindex="-1">Low-confidence Handling <a class="header-anchor" href="#low-confidence-handling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Low-confidence Handling&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Tickets that cannot be classified with high certainty are forwarded to a dedicated review queue. This mechanism avoids incorrect assignments and provides human operators with the opportunity to verify edge cases.</p><h2 id="multi-language-support" tabindex="-1">Multi-language Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#multi-language-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Multi-language Support&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Supports German and English out of the box and can be extended to additional languages. Teams operating across different regions benefit from consistent classification regardless of language.</p><h2 id="on-premise-deployment" tabindex="-1">On-Premise Deployment <a class="header-anchor" href="#on-premise-deployment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;On-Premise Deployment&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Runs entirely on your own infrastructure using Docker containers. No external services are required, ensuring that sensitive data never leaves your environment and simplifying compliance with privacy regulations.</p><h2 id="extensible-pipelines" tabindex="-1">Extensible Pipelines <a class="header-anchor" href="#extensible-pipelines" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Extensible Pipelines&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Custom Value Objects such as tags or Service-Level Agreements can be added to the classification pipeline. This extensibility means the software can grow with your needs and accommodate unique business rules.</p><h2 id="api-access" tabindex="-1">API Access <a class="header-anchor" href="#api-access" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;API Access&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A comprehensive HTTP REST API exposes all key functions for training, managing models, and predicting labels. The API makes it straightforward to integrate Open Ticket AI with existing ticket systems or other applications.</p><h2 id="otobo-integration" tabindex="-1">OTOBO Integration <a class="header-anchor" href="#otobo-integration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;OTOBO Integration&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For organizations using the OTOBO ticketing system, an add-on is available that enables seamless data exchange. Tickets created within OTOBO can be automatically enriched with AI predictions to assist your support staff.</p></div>`);
