description: Learn how to build and run modular data processing pipelines in Python
  using this framework. This guide covers the `Pipeline` class for executing a sequence
  of stages, the `Pipe` interface for creating custom processing components, and the
  `PipelineContext` object for managing shared state to create powerful, sequential
  data workflows.

### <span style='text-info'>class</span> `PipelineContext`

Context object passed between pipeline stages.
This class serves as a container for sharing state and data across different stages
of a processing pipeline. It uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization.

**Parameters:**

- **`ticket_id`** (`str`) - The unique identifier of the ticket being processed through
the pipeline stages.
- **`data`** (`dict[str, Any]`) - A flexible dictionary for storing arbitrary data exchanged
between pipeline stages. Defaults to an empty dictionary.

## Module: `open_ticket_ai\src\ce\run\pipeline\pipe.py`


### <span style='text-info'>class</span> `Pipe`

Interface for all pipeline components.
This abstract base class defines the common interface that all pipeline
components must implement. It inherits from `RegistryProvidableInstance`
to enable automatic registration in a component registry and from `ABC`
to enforce abstract method implementation.

Subclasses must implement the `process` method to define their specific
data transformation logic within the pipeline.

Attributes:
    Inherits attributes from `RegistryProvidableInstance` for registry management.


::: details #### <Badge type="info" text="method"/> <span class='text-warning'>def</span> `process(self, context: PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext`
Process a pipeline context object and return the modified context.
This method defines the core processing logic for a pipeline component.
It takes a `PipelineContext` object containing shared pipeline state,
performs transformations or operations on this context, and returns the
updated context for the next component in the pipeline.

Args:
    context: The current pipeline context containing shared state data.

Returns:
    The updated `PipelineContext` object after processing.

Raises:
    Implementation-specific exceptions may be raised by subclasses to
    indicate processing errors or invalid states.

## Module: `open_ticket_ai\src\ce\run\pipeline\pipeline.py`


### <span style='text-info'>class</span> `Pipeline`

Composite pipe executing a sequence of pipes.
The Pipeline class represents a composite pipe that executes a sequence of
individual pipes in a defined order. It implements the Pipe interface and
processes data by sequentially passing a context object through each
component pipe.

**Parameters:**

- **`pipes`** () - An ordered list of Pipe instances to execute sequentially.


::: details #### <Badge type="info" text="method"/> <span class='text-warning'>def</span> `__init__(self, config: PipelineConfig, pipes: List[Pipe])`
Initializes the Pipeline with configuration and component pipes.

**Parameters:**

- **`config`** () - Configuration settings for the pipeline.
- **`pipes`** () - Ordered list of Pipe instances to execute sequentially.

:::


::: details #### <Badge type="info" text="method"/> <span class='text-warning'>def</span> `execute(self, context: PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext`
Executes all pipes in the pipeline sequentially.
Processes the context through each pipe in the defined order, passing
the output of one pipe as input to the next.

**Parameters:**

- **`context`** () - The initial pipeline context containing data to process.

**Returns:** () - The final context after processing through all pipes.

:::


::: details #### <Badge type="info" text="method"/> <span class='text-warning'>def</span> `process(self, context: PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext`
Processes context through the entire pipeline.
This method implements the Pipe interface by delegating to execute().

**Parameters:**

- **`context`** () - The pipeline context to process.

**Returns:** () - The modified context after pipeline execution.
